===================================

Knockoffs are a powerful tool which can be used in combination with nearly any machine learning algorithm to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in feature selection. Knockoffs were initially developed in `Barber and Candes 2015`_ and `Candes et al 2018`_.

Knockpy is a python implementation of the knockoffs framework which makes it easy to apply knockoff-based inference in only a few lines of code. Knockpy is also built to be modular, so researchers and analysts can easily layer functionality on top of it. See usage for more details!
